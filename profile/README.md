## 🔍 What is Deepbinds?

**Deepbinds** is an evolving collective of independent personas and projects led by Julian Blacher (@devblac). Each persona explores a different aspect of modern software creation — from systems thinking to privacy, play, and beyond.

This space is where personal curiosity meets open collaboration.
